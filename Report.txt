Py City Schools
Written Report

The PyCitySchool dataset contains math and reading scores for a student population from 15 different schools. The data includes information
such as students' name, genders and grades, as well as school name, school type, school sizes and budgets.
The analysis aims to provide a summary of metrics based on math and reading performance in relation to school type, grade, etc.

The summary reveals that charter schools have higher performance in both math and reading compared to district schools. This conclusion
is also reflected in the top 5 performing schools, which are medium-sized charter schools. On the other hand, the lowest performing
schools are district schools.

Regardless of school type and grade, it can be observed that students' math scores are lower than the reading scores.
Additionally, it is noted that students in higher spending ranges have, on average, lower math and reading scores. Similarly, schools with 
larger student populations demonstrate lower performance than smaller schools.
